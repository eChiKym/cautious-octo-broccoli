what youre gonna find here is me writing shit because i dont have any other place in this world to put it
maybe someone will see this

maybe itll be someone i know

if you ask me about this, i didnt write this

---

i dont want to be a nerd
i dont want to sit in front of a computer anymore
i dont want to be good at anything
except vb maybe
because if im good at vb maybe theyll see me
if i was good at vb i would have joined them and i would be like them and not like this

even if i had them could i talk
to them i mean to really talk


right now feels like the world hates me
but the world has hated Him first so im ok right
what if im just victimizing myself
or maybe im overthinking it
God

i used to be someone who loved to be a victim
victims have it easy
victims have excuses
victims can be pitied
victims can run away and say it was trauma
that was before i knew what made a victim

the flat rabbit
shes a flat rabbit and she gets taped to a kite
maybe its about releasing deceased loved ones
but
i cant stop thinking about how maybe
the rabbit didnt want to fly
but they taped to rabbit to the kite anyways


icarus flew too close to the sun and his wings fell apart
when will my wings fail me

i was in class yesterday
spanish
JL told me to work on bugs
the kid next to me
NL
he noticed carabidae
he said ooh
and looked away
but i kept working
even though no one on this earth could see me

today i didnt do any work
i had all the time
and i spent it all
playing stupid games
this new year cant become the old year so quickly


also today during lunch
someone said 
i have a new philosophy

but i forgot it because it was so cliche
its so hard to become smart
but its harder to pretend to be smart


EY
i want to say sorry
but i didnt
because

i dont know

i saw AG yesterday and she walked away
i remembered what SH said
and i know why AG walked away
but you
i know why you walked away
but i didnt know how you didnt lash out

now i know that we have our own preferences


i always thought
that i was better
than me before

i always thought
that i improved

but the book of Judges
shows that its a cycle of life and death
of heaven and hell

so now i see
when i learn i am quick to forget
and when i forget i am slow to learn
God knows how i made it this far
and He also knows why i need to type out my thoughts on fucking github


im a liar
i lie
i would say i lie the most to myself but thats a lie
im sorry i lied
to everyone



i look back and i see how i might look
depressed

but
i
have
no
intention
of
leaving 
this
world
early

there are things to be done
a life to be lived
a God to be worshipped



i once considered the importance of my life
during fucking band class in middle school
i was so sad during lunch
but no one really gave a shit
i decided that my life wasnt that important but He was


IK is interesting
i dont know too much
i dont want to judge
but
i thought about how he follows the cooler kids
and only talks to me when theres no better alternative

but i also thought about how i do the same thing to my friends

so when i say that i want better friends
i dont mean to hurt you
im sorry
i just cant see what makes a friend

IK said that he felt lonely
i do too
and when he said that
i didnt feel so special
i was using that lonliness as an excuse

its obvious
my lonliness i mean its appearent
typing on fucking github instead of texting my best friend

IK and i are alike
got me thinking
because im pretty sure everybody feels the same

1/12/26
why cant i be special
how come everyone
has cried themselves to bed


i swore again
fuck
i guess they broke me


today
i cried
i dont know why
i just said
sorry
to my parents
even though they couldnt hear

i cried
when i looked at myself in the mirror
when i thought about how much i learned
when i realized that im privileged
tears are dry now
but now i know

anger bursts under pressure
but not really
under pressure
it escapes
under silent tears

how come
the more i know
the less i know

i keep writing on github
maybe im weird
but someday
ill come back to this

i was such an ass back then

---
im gonna fucking medal at mit

i will

Through God

For everyone

and no one can stop me
